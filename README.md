Title: 'Missing Migrants'

Introduction: 
29,361 people have died or gone missing in the Mediterranean sea since 2014. 

Data:
IOM's Missing Migrants Project
Data on arrivals and interceptions are based on data from national authorities (Spanish Ministry of the Interior, Italian Ministry of interior, Hellenic Coast Guard, Turkish Coast Guard, Libyan Coast Guard, Algerian Ministry of Interior, Tunisian National Guard, and Tunisian Ministry of Interior
Open-Meteo API

Main challenges:
API
GitHub
Finding a focus area within the topic - scope of work and timing of presentation
Deciding what to visualise
Nature of the topic

Hypothese/Guiding questions: 
What is the year with the highest number of missing people in the Mediterranean sea?
Does weather play a big role? Does the number of incidents in the Mediterranean correlate with the number of people who died or went missing in the Mediterranean sea?

Methodology: Research, Data collection, Data wrangling, API, EDA

Conclusions after analysis:
Weather does not play an important factor in determining the number of incidents. If there were safe and legal routes for people to get to Europe, there would be no incidents at all. Other likely factors in determining the number of incidents are: EU Policies, interceptions at sea, the continued obstruction of the work of NGOs carrying out SAR operations, and unseaworthy and/or overcrowded boats
There does not appear to be a correlation between the number of incidents and the number of people who have died or gone missing. Although fewer people have died or gone missing whilst crossing the Mediterranean in recent years, than in 2015/2016, the number of incidents has not decreased but rather increased. This could be a result of the SAR work being carried out by NGOs.
